**Anna Celmer-Falkiewicz**

Graduated from the Fryderyk Chopin University of Music in Warsaw in the conducting class of Professor Bogdan Gola at 
the Faculty of Musical Education. She also studied in the vocal class at the same university. She had completed with 
honours her secondary musical education both in rhythmics and vocal solo in the class of Professor Bożena Betley. 
As she loves Polish language and its articulation issues, so vital in the vocal art, she obtained also the
professional title of speech - language therapist at the University of Warsaw.

She took her first artistic steps on the stage of the National Theatre and Opera House in Warsaw, 
singing for a couple of years in the choir. There she got priceless expertise both in work on stage and in vocal 
and performance work. She worked during the next years as a soprano soloist and a vocal pedagogue in the Warsaw Boys’ 
and Men’s Choir at the University of Music. She also cooperated with the Roma Musical Theatre in Warsaw.

Between 2000 and 2005 she was the conductor of the Ars Cantata choir at the Club of Catholic Intelligentsia; 
then she won numerous top awards at international and nationwide choir competitions, 
of which:
* 1st place at the 1st Passion Song Festival in Bydgoszcz (2003)
* ‘Golden Ribbon’ and the special prize of the jury ‘the greatest artistic event’: 1st Mazovian Choir Review
* 1st place at the 35th Choral Tournament Legnica Cantat in the category of ‘other amateur choirs’ (2004)

The recording of the choir’s competition performance was on the air of Polish Radio 2. In 2003 she recorded with 
Ars Cantata the choir’s first disc with the selected repertoire.
As an art director and a soloist she conducted her own Vocal Ensemble ‘Alterno’ affiliated at the 
Polish Military Cathedral between 2004 and 2010.

Since 2010, Anna Celmer- Falkiewicz has been cooperating as a vocalist with the ensemble Cappella Corale Varsaviana.

Despite the words of Wisława Szymborska ‘nothing can ever happen twice...’, in April 2012 
she was appointed to conduct the Ars Cantata choir again.
