For a number of years the Choir has been changing its personal profile. At the very beginning Ars Cantata
was an academic choir; later on it consisted of graduates of Warsaw universities and high schools.

Today, we are not gathering because of what we do in our every day lives. We meet two times a week
for we are very fond of music, in fact the Art of Singing. The Choir means for us spending our free time
in the most valuable manner and realizing the passion for singing.

Among our singers – amateurs are architects, lawyers, doctors, teachers, managers, workers of huge corporations and
representatives of many other professions.

It is quite probable that we would have never met if it was not
for the Choir:-) And as our roads already crossed (and as you know – nothing happens without reason),
we are very keen on enjoying both singing and sharing our joy with others.
Therefore, you should see our concerts.
