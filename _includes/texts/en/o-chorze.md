The Chamber Choir ”Ars Cantata” has been an amateur choir since 1986. It was one of the Klub Inteligencji Katolickiej section in Warsaw.

The Choir’s repertoire includes both sacred and secular chamber pieces a cappella, Polish and foreign songs, from various époques – from the Medieval Ages to the present times (Arcadelt, Gorczycki, Strawiński, Poulenc, Ravel, Serocki, Sawa, Koszewski). The Choir performs also Orthodox and folk songs, as well as arrangements of popular songs for four voices.

Ars Cantata is specialising in interpretations of contemporary music, particularly pieces of some Polish composers (for which it was frequently awarded), e.g. Salve Regina and Tryptyk Maryjny by Marian Sawa, Zdrowaś Królewno Wyborna and Miserere by Andrzej Koszewski and others.

The Choir performs both in churches and concert halls (Teatr Wielki, Akademia Muzyczna); and is very willing to participate in any events and charity concerts (Voices for Hospices and others), as well as theatre projects.

The Chamber Choir Ars Cantata has been awarded many prizes at recognised choir festivals and competitions in Poland and abroad.
